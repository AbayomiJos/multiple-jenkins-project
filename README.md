# Building a multibranch Pipeline project

This repository is for the
[Build a multibranch Pipeline project](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

This tutorial uses the same application that the 
[Build a Node.js and React app with npm](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/)
tutorial is based on. Therefore, you'll be building and testing the same
application but this time, its delivery will be different depending on the Git
branch that Jenkins builds from. That is, the branch being built determines
which delivery stage of your Pipeline is executed.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
either the "Deliver for development" or "Deploy for production" stages of your
Pipeline (depending on the branch that Jenkins builds from).

# Getting Started with Create React App ([npx create-react-app tutorial](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/))

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
